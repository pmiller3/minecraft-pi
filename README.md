# minecraft-pi
Repository for holding Minecraft Pi projects.  These are intended to be educational in nature; crucially, I am not a Python programmer, while that appears to be the preferred language for these sorts of things.  I have created some with Java as well, to expand reach and allow for comparison.  I would like to separate these into lessons, so that they could be followed in order and build upon one another learning various concepts along the way.

I'd also like it to be a little more engaging - there are many resource out there that will go into greater detail about the differences between a `long` and an `int` in Java, zero-based indexing and the like, but I find those hard to relate to for the crowd Minecraft might attract.  I know they're important, and their time will come, but for me the most interesting part of computers and programmers is when I actually *do* something very tangible in a context I understand.

## Lesson 1 - Hello Minecraft
This should be pretty straightfoward - just a skeletal project to demonstrate that you indeed have your development environment and Minecraft setup appropriately.
- Development environment is setup
- Library is imported correctly
- Minecraft is running correctly
- Connection can be established and we can see proof of interaction
- Introduction to markdown!

## Lesson 2 - Jump!
This lesson will build upon the previous one, and introduce some more concepts:
- Storing information in a variable
- API calls to gather info about the world (in this case, the player position)
- API calls to set something in the world (in this case, translate the player position)
- Reading from a file (not Minecraft, just coding!)
- Introduction to .gitignore

## Lesson 3 - Greenfeet
This lesson will build upon the previous one, and introduce some more concepts:
- Control structures (Loops and If statements)
- API calls to gather info about the world in the loop
- API calls to set info conditionally

## Lesson 4 - Frostwalker Boots
This lesson will build upon the previous one, and introduce some more concepts:
- Tracking state over time
- Lists!
- Functions!

# Future lesson ideas

## Lesson 5 - Footwear (as an abstraction)
This lesson will take the previous 3, and allow us to share some of the footwear code, to allow for easy creation and combination of footwear.
- Inheritance

## Lesson 6 - Read more (files)
This lesson will expand into more file reading, so we can build something based on data.
- File reading
- Try/Catch, Exceptions
