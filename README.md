# minecraft-pi
Repository for holding Minecraft Pi projects.  These are intended to be educational in nature; crucially, I am not a Python programmer, while that appears to be the preferred language for these sorts of things.  I intend to create some with Java as well, but we'll see how that goes.  I would like to separate these into lessons, so that they could be followed in order and build upon one another learning various concepts along the way.

## Lesson 1 - Hello Minecraft
This should be pretty straightfoward - just a skeletal project to demonstrate that you indeed have your development environment and Minecraft setup appropriately.
- Development environment is setup
- Library is imported correctly
- Minecraft is running correctly
- Connection can be established and we can see proof of interaction
- Introduction to markdown!

## Lesson 2 - Jump!
This lesson will build upon the previous one, and introduce some more concepts:
- Storing information in a variable
- API calls to gather info about the world (in this case, the player position)
- API calls to set something in the world (in this case, translate the player position)
- Reading from a file (not Minecraft, just coding!)
- Introduction to .gitignore

## Lesson 3 - Greenfeet
This lesson will build upon the previous one, and introduce some more concepts:
- Control structures (Loops and If statements)
- API calls to gather info about the world in the loop
- API calls to set info conditionally

## Lesson 4 - Frostwalker Boots
This lesson will build upon the previous one, and introduce some more concepts:
- Tracking state over time
- Lists!
- Functions!
